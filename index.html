    This is a story. A story about a communications technology
that actually makes it easier to communicate, rather than harder.  The end of the 2010's was drawing to a close and a programmer
had an idea. No human technology has successfully mimicked human
communication habits since the telephone. Instead of reinventing
social media or email for messaging, why not draw inspiration from
non-digital means.

It was a challenging thought. Email, social media, and various
online message groups all behave asynchronously. That is, every
message is sent out without any confirmation that the receiver
has actually gotten it. A receieved phone call, by contrast,
behaves inherently differently than these digital means. When
a phone call is successfully received, both parties know it
immediately. When a phone call is not successfully received, the
caller also knows as well.

While there may be some uncertainty about whether a follow up
voice mail has been received, there are few cases when you would
be confused about receipt of a call. Imagine, this developer
thought, if other platforms shared this ready immediacy.

"I sent you that email two months ago. You mean to tell me that
<em>with the 150 emails you get a day</em> you didn't get it?
"You didn't get my critical party invitation because you were
<em>taking a break from Facebook? No one takes a break from
Facebook</em> You mean you didn't get my Slack notification
because you forgot to put your phone on the charger last night?
<em> Don't you check your phone as soon as you wake up?</em>

It became clear to this developer that part of the reason the
tech industry has invented so many competing and incomplete
communication system is that, unlike in face-to-face communications,
in digital communications there isn't built-in way of enforcing
social norms and expectations for how to communicate, not in the
way that face-to-face communications allow for.

It's worth noting here that the norms of face-to-face or telephone
conversations are not agreed upon either. American culture puts
an emphasis on making eye contact during speech. This is a cultural
expectation, to be sure, which may be flaunted for numerous reasons,
but it can be quickly noticed and corrected. "Look at me when you're
speaking." A person ignoring a flooded inbox or taking a Facebook
break gets no such feedback, except when that critical message
doesn't get received.

But what if, what if your digital communications could give you
a heads up about the likelihood that a user would receive a
message, and the likelihood a user would respond? What if other
problems, that are baked into communication actually found some
method or algorithmic expression that current systems lack?

For instance, sites like Stack Overflow implement a reputation
system. Giving people accurate and correct information over time
sends your answers to the top and offers you more access to site
features. A trust based system is baked into the platform, and
Stack Overflow answers themselves have good reputation off the
platform.

But trust is but one component of a communication system. What
if, from the ground up, each of the age-old problems of communication
were acknowledged and some semblance of a solution, one that could
be continually improved from the beginning, came with the implementation
in the first place? These were the initial thoughts that led to
the platform we know today as &hellip;
